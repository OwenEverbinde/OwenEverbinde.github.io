<h1>It&#39;s Either Or</h1>

<p><a href="#table">back to contents</a></p>

<p>If ever I get famous, I hope one of my quotes goes: &ldquo;you can only have one number one priority.&rdquo; Because as obvious a tautology as that is, it describes my life. If I want to spend my mornings helping my brother through math, I cannot also spend those same mornings writing. If I want to walk the family&#39;s dog every day, I cannot spend that same time relaxing at home. Everything we do is placed in a hierarchy of importance.</p>

<p>This hierarchy also comes into play when I choose how to gather information and improve myself. Do I seek self-improvement through TED talks? Do I listen to a speech by the Dalai Lama? Do I delve into fiction, hoping to find metaphors to answer my questions? Do I use religion, spirituality, drugs, meditation, science, or self-help?</p>

<p>I cannot use them all.</p>

<p>I must prioritize that which is most helpful for me, and most likely to bring me positive change. So the path I take toward happiness and meaning must contain certain attributes:</p>

<ol>
<li>Must help me progress toward my goals</li>
<li>Must do so in a reasonable time frame</li>
<li>Must use reliable methods to impart truth</li>
<li>Must leave little chance for misinterpretation</li>
<li>Must not deal emotional or mental damage</li>
</ol>

<p>ProCon.org lists <a href="https://undergod.procon.org/religions-and-denominations-in-the-us/">313 religions and denominations</a> in the United States. Some sites say there are well over 30,000 Christian denominations alone worldwide. But for the sake of simplicity, let&#39;s pretend there are only the 313 (and keep in mind that the 313 seems to include &ldquo;Humanist,&rdquo; which doesn&#39;t necessarily entail any particular theistic beliefs.)</p>

<p>I have not deeply explored each and every one of the 313, but I have seen enough to notice some troubling patterns that emerge from a god-belief, and make me want to avoid any religion that is predicated upon such a belief.</p>

<p><a name="goals"><a></p>

<h1>1: Goals</h1>

<p><a href="#table">back to contents</a></p>

<p>This is the most important one. A god that doesn&#39;t want me to achieve my dreams is a god I don&#39;t want to follow. Such a god would be asking me to sacrifice my deepest desires for his approval. In effect, that&#39;s like wishing unhappiness upon me for my entire tenure as his apostle.</p>

<p>This might seem like a minor ask to some, but already, some of the 313 would declare me proud for this assertion alone. I have been approached by Christians who believed I ought to bow down before god &ndash; not the other way around. They would clutch their pearls if I joined their church and expected their god&#39;s laws to take a back seat to my mental, emotional, and social needs. They would especially balk at my belief that I &ndash; a mere human mortal &ndash; could possibly understand what my true needs were.</p>

<h3>Moral Obligation</h3>

<p><a href="#table">back to contents</a></p>

<p>And would they really be wrong? If some other sect or belief system from the 313 were to look at the above and declare &ldquo;such a person is misinformed!&rdquo; Then what basis are they using to make that assessment? Often times it&#39;s just faith either way, and the hellfire-and-brimstone preacher who approaches me at a transit center cannot be considered insincere, or lax in his faith. To the contrary, he devotes his life to studying and understanding the words of his god. And he attempts to share his understanding to save as many lost lambs as possible. Can someone who prays and studies in a similar manner to this preacher really say he used the wrong methods to arrive at his conclusions?</p>

<p>Leaving differing conclusions aside, the idea of an omnibenevolent, omniscient, omnipotent god in the first place comes with a certain amount of moral obligation.</p>

<p>If there is a god who knows all and loves all, then who am I to say what my own needs are? Surely it is reasonable to trust this god instead, even if the directions he lays out seem to harm me more than help? Surely there is some plan outside of my understanding, intended to land me exactly where I truly need to be? Or a plan intended to help other people more than it hurts me? If there really is a tri-omni god, then people have a duty to fulfill his directions regardless of the pain it causes them. Because such a god would not cause them unnecessary pain.</p>

<p>These are reasonable conclusions to land on, yet see where they can take a person: all of a sudden, you have a person who believes their own desires and feelings aren&#39;t important. If they feel pain as a result of their attempts to comply with this god&#39;s directions, these conclusions could easily dismiss the red flags that show that this god is hurting them. After all, it&#39;s natural to conclude that their god would put them through momentary discomfort in order to bring them &ndash; or their loved ones &ndash; a deeper, truer happiness than they could possibly have known otherwise.</p>

<p>Almost by definition, these people &ndash; through their belief in a tri-omni god &ndash; begin to trust themselves less and take care of themselves less.</p>

<p>In order to look after themselves, a god&#39;s followers must maintain an inviolable tenet. But no matter how this tenet is phrased, it seems to contradict itself partway through.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s one example. To prevent followers from enduring undo damage for some greater good, they must believe the greater good is not actually greater, or that there is no greater good:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Even though god knows all &ndash; and knows far more than I &ndash; he cannot know my needs better than I know them.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here&#39;s a similar one:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Even though God loves all, knows all, and has power over all, his plans are not always the best for me or the people I love.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>These prevent the god-belief from destroying their holder&#39;s health and well-being. At least, the second half of each statement does. But the logical inconsistency is too strong to be reconciled.</p>

<p>Perhaps the believer will attempt to rephrase these things,</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Even though God knows all, loves all, and has power over all, if his plans &ndash; rather, if the plans I had attributed to him &ndash; start to damage my well-being, then they were not his plans after all.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Unlike the earlier statements, this one has no serious contradictions. But it also doesn&#39;t contain actionable information: one needs to know what &ldquo;damage to your well-being&rdquo; entails in order to interpret the statement into something meaningful.</p>

<p>So witness:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>God knows all, loves all, and has power over all. Nevertheless, I must prioritize my own understanding of my own needs. I must prioritize that understanding over any god I might chance to believe in. I must prioritize that understanding over any interpretation I might have of my god&#39;s texts.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Bringing it back to my goals, I know I want to write and eventually teach people to write. I know I want to build a writing community that thrives and welcomes fledgling writers. I want to build something encouraging and exciting for everyone involved. And according to the above compromise between religion and self, I can never allow this dream to come second to any deity, real or imagined.</p>

<p>This is all well and good at preventing a god-belief from damaging me.</p>

<p>However, this is exactly how a man conducts himself when he does not believe in a god.</p>
